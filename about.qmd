title: "Payment Project"
---
This project is about designing and developing a complete order and redeem rewards application. This system
allows users to accumulate points by engaging in volunteer activities, and they can use the points to place orders
of food and beverage (F&B) in merchants on campus. The solution will consist of a mobile app and a web page.
The mobile app comprises NETS QR payment option, and NETS Click mobile payment simulators along with
several APIs like F&B merchants and volunteer charities to provide a smooth user experience. The web page
contains an analytics dashboard that provides useful insights for users.
The project will have three distinct segments: (1) a Flutter-programmed mobile app where volunteers can keep
track and use rewards; (2) ties with the NETS payment APIs to make test purchases; and (3) a web-based
analytics dashboard in which to observe trends in F&B purchases and volunteer activities. The team used
full-stack development principles, user-centered design, and agile project management over a period of three
months development cycle.
The solution contributes to the efficiency of the process of food ordering on campus and redemption of reward
points. It enables us, as students, to obtain skillsets that are important in FinTech and the digital industry in
Singapore.
