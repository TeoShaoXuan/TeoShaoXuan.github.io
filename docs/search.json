    "text": "This project is about designing and developing a complete order and redeem rewards application. This system allows users to accumulate points by engaging in volunteer activities, and they can use the points to place orders of food and beverage (F&B) in merchants on campus. Our solution was a mobile app and a web page. The mobile app comprises NETS QR payment option, and NETS Click mobile payment simulators along with several APIs like F&B merchants and volunteer charities to provide a smooth user experience. The web page contains an analytics dashboard for users. The project has three distinct segments: a Flutter-programmed mobile app where volunteers can keep track and use rewards; ties with the NETS payment APIs to make test purchases; and a web-based analytics dashboard in which to observe trends in F&B purchases and volunteer activities. The solution contributes to the efficiency of the process of food ordering on campus and redemption of reward points. It enables us students, to obtain skillsets that are important in FinTech and the digital industry in Singapore.\n\nThis was a Figma prototype for the mobile application interface."
