title: "Reflection on the use of GenAI"
---

Throughout my time in Uni. GenAI has been a huge help to me. As it is incredibly accessible to everyone. but due to that accessibility i fear that i am relying on it too much. using it too much when i encounter a simple problem.

I have been using it to help me study and sometimes asking it to generate questions for me to test knowledge on if there are no mock tests available one the Xsite.
